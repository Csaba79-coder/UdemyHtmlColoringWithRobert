    <!-- rgb - red green and blue!  0 - 255 zero less, 255 more color of it! -->
    <!-- rgba  - red green and blue and alpha!!!  0 - 255 zero less, 255 more color of it! alpha value from 0.0 till 1.0 if you choose 0.5 means 50% opacity of the color!-->
    <!-- color with using # rr gg bb and sometimes aa  from 00 till ff (all of them!)-->
    <!-- color with using # rr gg bb aa and sometimes aa  from 00 till ff (all of them!) aa as alpha! 80 at the end will gives 50% opacity of the color! (like 0.5 at rgba!)-->
    <!-- hsl - hue /color value/ saturation /color intensity/ lightness /amount of light or dark color/ percent from zero till 100 percent! less percent in lightness means more dark of color! -->
    <!-- hue is from 0-360 and saturation and lightness l 0-100 % alpha works the same as before! -->
    <!-- hsla  - hue saturation lightness a goes from 0.0 till 1.0 but also worked with percent! 0.5 = 50%-->
